            <h2>How to Access the Dark Web?</h2>
            <p>Accessing the Dark Web requires the use of an anonymizing browser called Tor. The Tor browser routes your web page requests through a series of proxy servers operated by thousands of volunteers around the globe, rendering your IP address unidentifiable and untraceable.</p>
